/// This trait belongs to any devices with an arbitrary number of "n-way" modes in which
/// the modes and settings for each mode are arbitrary and unique to each device or device type.
/// Each mode has multiple possible settings,
/// but only one can be selected at a time; a dryer cannot be in "delicate," "normal," and
/// "heavy duty" mode simultaneously. A setting that simply can be turned on or off belongs in the [crate::traits::Toggles] trait.
///
/// For instance, a washing machine can have settings for load size and temperature.
/// These would both be modes because they are independent of each other,
/// but each can be in only one state at a time.
/// The user can set a mode such as temperature explicitly with a command like Set the washerâ€™s temperature to cold.
///
/// Some modes are "ordered" and can also be adjusted with up/down, increase/decrease verbiage.
/// For example, load size (small, medium, large) and temperature are clearly ordered
/// (note that temperature is not an actual thermostat with a numeric target, as on other devices),
/// but load type (delicates, normal, wool, etc) may not be.
///
/// This trait covers one or more individual modes which users can set. In general,
/// these modes should be used for functionality that is unlinked from other device behavior.
/// Linked behavior, such as turning the device itself on or off,
/// should use more specific traits (for example, the thermostatMode in the trait [crate::traits::TemperatureSetting]).
